## Overview

### The challenge

1. Creating responsive design
2. Using Node.js as backend
3. Using MySQL for database
4. Insert / update / display MySQL data
5. Creating "smooth" experience
6. Asynchronous chart data loading

### Links

⛔ No live link ⛔

Reason:  
No free PaaS that can deploy Node.js with MySQL

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Javascript
-   Node.js with the following packages:
    -   Express.js
    -   MySQL
    -   Dotenv

### What I learned

1. Learnt new framework

    - My first time ever learning new framework: Chart.js!

2. Learnt the basics of Node.js

    - Learnt how to install packages and use them properly
    - Learnt how to interact with local files
    - Learnt easier way to do GET & POST request through Express.js

3. Communication with MySQL

4. Managing package with npm

```bash
npm install
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon app
```

### Continued development

The hardest part of this project is incorporating Node.js.
By hard, I mean there are a lot of things I need to learn to use it well.
The package itself is not necessarily hard.

I think I only scratched the surface of Node.js.
And the way I wrote this project feels like "bootstrap-y" if that makes sense.

I would need to learn and practice more Node.js to really know how I can get this fixed.
